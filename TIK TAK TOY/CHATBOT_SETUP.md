# ðŸ¤– Chatbot Setup Guide

## Problem: Chatbot Only Says "Sorry"

If your chatbot is only responding with "sorry" messages, it's likely due to API connection issues. Here's how to fix it:

## âœ… Solution 1: Use the Proxy Server (Recommended)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Run the Proxy Server
```bash
npm run proxy
```

### Step 3: Access the Website
- Open: `http://localhost:3001`
- Or: `http://localhost:3001/website`

### Step 4: Update API Configuration
Replace the API configuration in your HTML files:

**In `index.html` and `website.html`, change:**
```html
<script src="api-config.js"></script>
```

**To:**
```html
<script src="api-config-proxy.js"></script>
```

## âœ… Solution 2: Direct API (Alternative)

If you want to use the direct API approach:

### Step 1: Check API Key
Make sure your DeepSeek API key is valid and has sufficient credits.

### Step 2: Run the Game Server
```bash
npm start
```

### Step 3: Access the Game
- Open: `http://localhost:3000`

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Issue: CORS Errors
- **Solution**: Use the proxy server (Solution 1)

### Issue: API Timeout
- **Solution**: The chatbot will use fallback responses automatically

### Issue: Network Problems
